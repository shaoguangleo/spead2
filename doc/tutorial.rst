Tutorial
========
This chapter will start by walking you through creating basic sender and
receiver applications. The resulting application will *not* be
high-performance, and will not cover all the features of the library. From
there we will gradually evolve the applications to improve performance and
demonstrate more features of the library.

Most of the tutorial covers both C++ and Python: just click the appropriate
tab in code examples. Some low-level performance features are not accessible
from the Python API.
